/*
Leonard and Sheldon are the best of friends. They know each other so well that they even developed their own language to exchange secret messages. However, they have recently made a new friend, Raj, who has difficulty understanding the two when they communicate in their language.

Leonard and Sheldonâ€™s language is similar to Pig Latin. Their unique language consists of usual English words transformed by shifting the first two letters in a word to the end and adding a suffix 'ae'.

Help Raj translate and decode his friends' secret messages.
