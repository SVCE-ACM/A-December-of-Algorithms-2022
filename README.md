 ### December 1 - William Butcher's Mission

   #### Problem Statement
   The mission of William Butcher and his crew is to free the US from the control of Supes. The Supes are seeking to destabilize the country by infiltrating the military in an effort to influence the administration. 
   
  A refugee in the United States from Asia, a Supe, was able to get away from the concentration camps. A crew member who was originally from Spain had an unplanned encounter with them and sought to make up with her despite having trouble understanding her when she tried to speak with the crew. 
  
  After careful analysis, MM discovered that she had employed a string of Hexadecimal characters and digits. 
  
  Design an algorithm to help the crew fully comprehend her hints.

 ### December 2 - The Secret Language

   #### Problem Statement
   Leonard and Sheldon are the best of friends. They know each other so well that they even developed their own language to exchange secret messages. However, they have recently made a new friend, Raj, who has difficulty understanding the two when they communicate in their language.
   
Leonard and Sheldon’s language is similar to Pig Latin. Their unique language consists of usual English words transformed by shifting the first two letters in a word to the end and adding a suffix 'ae'.

Help Raj translate and decode his friends' secret messages.

```
    
    The first line of input is the number of days Harper is going to consider for her analysis.
    The second line of input is the stock market change values for those given days.

    In order to find the best period of time to sell in order to maximise profit, 
    Harper must find the maximum sum of all the stock change values in every possible subset of days from the given set.

    In the given sample input, it is found that out of all the subsets obtained, the one having the maximum sum was the entire set as a whole. 
    And thus, the company will be able to make maximum profit if they sell on all the days in that given period of time.

### December 6 - Swapped
#### Problem Statement
Bob and Tanika are best friends. They were bored so they decided to play a game. The game they chose to play involved a set of ‘n’ positive numbers. 
The player who goes first must choose a position ‘p’ and their turn ends with that. 
In the subsequent turns,  the player must first subtract the value in the first position by 1 and swap it with the value in position ‘p’. 
The players will take alternate turns and the game goes on till the value in the first position becomes 0. 
The player whose turn it is loses the game when the value in the first position becomes 0.
Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally and display the winner's name.


<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105559815/205705632-898b9a40-ae67-48e6-a496-abb07e90aa36.png" width="400"></p>

 #### Sample Input/Output
     
```    
 Input:
  Position=3
  Set of numbers: 5 4 4 
  Player going first: Tanika


Output:
   Tanika wins the game!
   Bob loses the game!


```

 #### Explanation
 ```
        1) 5 4 4 (initial)
        
            Tanika chooses position 3
            
        2) 4 4 4 (bob)
        
            5-1, swapping (5-1) with value in position 3 (4)
            
        3) 4 4 3 (tanika)
        4) 3 4 3 (bob)
        5) 3 4 2 (tanika)
        6) 2 4 2 (bob)
        7) 2 4 1 (tanika)
        8) 1 4 1 (bob)
        9) 1 4 0 (tanika)
        10) 0 4 0 (bob)
        
        Since, on bob's turn the initial value at the first position is 0, he loses the game.

### December 9 - Kochouseph Konundrum!
#### Problem Statement
Kochouseph Chittilappilly went to Dhruv Zplanet , a gaming space, with his friends and played a game called “Guess the Word”.

Rules of the game are –

Computer displays some strings on the screen and the player should pick one string / word if this word matches with the random word that the computer picks then the player is declared as Winner.

Kochouseph Chittilappilly’s friends played the game and no one won the game. This is Kochouseph Chittilappilly’s turn to play and he decided to win the game.
What he observed from his friend’s game is that the computer is picking up the first string whose length is odd and is of maximum length. 

Due to system failures computers sometimes cannot generate odd length words. In such cases you will lose the game irrespective of whether you guess the right word or not and it displays “better luck next time”. 

Write a program to help Kochouseph win the game.


<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110716198/206476505-7cc0c18c-4034-46e1-8cd4-7e2ef8f72801.png" width="400"></p>

 #### Sample Input/Output

### December 10 - Play with words
#### Problem Statement
A group of students were playing a word game. They divided themselves into teams and had 4 rounds. 

One round was the pronunciation round. One team challenged the other team to pronounce “schtschurowskia”. It was difficult for both the teams to pronounce the word. They approached their teacher for help. He gave them a hint. 

Have a look at the hint!

Hint:
 A word is hard to pronounce if it contains 4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. 
 
For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.   After giving them an example, he asked them  to solve the following problem.
 
Given: A string S consisting of N lowercase Latin characters. 

To Determine:  Whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above — print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.
For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters {a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 21 characters.
Help them solve the problem.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105559815/206757545-341cbd7a-d12a-4af9-8d1f-a4da640343b4.jpg" width="400"></p>

 #### Sample Input/Output
     
```

apple
15
schtschurowskia
6
polish
5
tryst
3
cry

Output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
 
 ```
 
#### Explanation:

 ```

Input Format:

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of string S.
The second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output Format:

For each test case, output on a new line the answer — YES if S is easy to pronounce, and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yeS, yes, and YeS will all be treated as identical.

Constraints:

1≤T≤100

1≤N≤100

S contains only lowercase Latin characters, i.e, the characters {a,b,c…….z}

```

### December 11 - Monkey jump
#### Problem Statement

A list is provided with a sequence of characters ‘_ _’    and ‘~’ in it Eg = [‘_’,’_’,’~’,’_’]. The character ‘_’ represents land and the character ‘~’ represents water. A monkey can move 1 step or 2 steps at a time. Another list is provided which contains the step that the monkey took Eg[1,1,2,1,2]. Whenever the monkey touches the water. The game is over and the score must be returned. Calculate the Jumps the monkey took before touching the water's surface.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119495356/206857020-3aefe633-ed69-4eef-a285-ef6ab27ac6ff.jpg" width="400" height="400"></p>
 

 #### Sample Input/Output
     
```    
Input 1:

[‘_’,’~’,’_’,’_’,’_’,’_’,’~’,’_’,’_’,’~’,’_’,’~’]


Output 1:

Score =8

Input 2:

[‘_’,’~’,’_’,’~’,’_’,’_’,’~’,’_’,’_’,’~’,’_’,’~’]

Output 2: 

Score =2

 ```
 
#### Explanation:

 ```

The input is a combination of ‘_’ and ‘~’ representing land and water respectively.
2 jumps indicate, for example, initially being on position 1 and ending up on position 3 without landing on position 2 in between.
 
Monkey takes two jumps as first move and three single jumps as next moves. But after taking two jumps the monkey touches the water . 
The jump sequence: [2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1]
So the total jump count is 8.

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. 

Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. 

Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. 

Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! 

Any and all languages are welcome. 

Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this out [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. 

Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`

**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. 

Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
